# CustomerAnalysis
This Jupyter Notebook is used to perform customer personality analysis following the CRISP-DM process. 
As specified in Kaggle’s website, customer personality analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers.
With the use of the dataset, we are trying to give an answer to the following questions: 
-	What is the "average" customer that we are the most likely to attract in each sales campaign ?
-	What is the preferred sale channel per product ?
-	What is the profile of those customers that prefer online or catalog shopping / shopping directly in stores ?
-	What are the consumer behaviors/characteristics with the highest importance when predicting customer's yearly income ?
